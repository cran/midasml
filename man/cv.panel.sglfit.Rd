\usage{
cv.panel.sglfit(x, y, lambda = NULL, gamma = 1.0, gindex = 1:p, nfolds = 10, 
  foldid, method = c("pooled", "fe"), nf = NULL, parallel = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{T by p data matrix, where t and p respectively denote the sample size and the number of regressors.}

\item{y}{T by 1 response variable.}

\item{lambda}{a user-supplied lambda sequence. By leaving this option unspecified (recommended), users can have the program compute its own \ifelse{html}{\out{&lambda;}}{\eqn{\lambda}} sequence based on \ifelse{html}{\out{<code>nlambda</code>}}{\code{nlambda}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{&gamma;}}{\eqn{\gamma}} \code{lambda.factor.} It is better to supply, if necessary, a decreasing sequence of lambda values than a single (small) value, as warm-starts are used in the optimization algorithm. The program will ensure that the user-supplied \code{lambda} sequence is sorted in decreasing order before fitting the model.}

\item{gamma}{sg-LASSO mixing parameter. \ifelse{html}{\out{&gamma;}}{\eqn{\gamma}} = 1 gives LASSO solution and \ifelse{html}{\out{&gamma;}}{\eqn{\gamma}} = 0 gives group LASSO solution.}

\item{gindex}{p by 1 vector indicating group membership of each covariate.}

\item{nfolds}{number of folds of the cv loop. Default set to \code{10}.}

\item{foldid}{the fold assignments used.}

\item{method}{choose between 'pooled' and 'fe'; 'pooled' forces the intercept to be fitted in \link{sglfit}, 'fe' computes the fixed effects. User must input the number of fixed effects \code{nf} for \code{method = 'fe'}, and it is recommended to do so for \code{method = 'pooled'}. Program uses supplied \code{nf} to construct \code{foldsid}. Default is set to \code{method = 'pooled'}.}

\item{nf}{number of fixed effects. Used only if \code{method = 'fe'}.}

\item{parallel}{if \code{TRUE}, use parallel foreach to fit each fold. Must register parallel before hand, such as doMC or others. See the example below.}

\item{...}{Other arguments that can be passed to \code{sglfit}.}
}
\value{
cv.panel.sglfit object.

\description{
Does k-fold cross-validation for panel data sg-LASSO regression model.

The function runs \code{sglfit} \code{nfolds+1} times; the first to get the path solution in \ifelse{html}{\out{&lambda;}}{\eqn{\lambda}} sequence, the rest to compute the fit with each of the folds omitted. 
The average error and standard deviation over the folds is computed, and the optimal regression coefficients are returned for \code{lam.min} and \code{lam.1se}. Solutions are computed for a fixed \ifelse{html}{\out{&gamma;}}{\eqn{\gamma}.}
